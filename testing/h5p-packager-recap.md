# H5P Packager Development Recap

## Project Overview

We developed a modular H5P content packager that allows for easy packaging of different H5P content types, focusing initially on Drag the Words and a general folder structure packager.

## Key Accomplishments

1. Created a base packager class (`H5PPackager`) to handle common packaging operations.
2. Developed specific packager classes for different content types (Drag the Words, Folder Structure).
3. Implemented a GUI for easy selection of content directory, output file, and package type.
4. Resolved issues with file naming conventions and import statements.
5. Addressed content validation issues by filtering allowed file types and properly structuring the H5P package.

## Process for Building Modular Sets

1. **Create Base Packager**
   - Develop a `base_packager.py` file with a `H5PPackager` class.
   - Implement common methods like `_add_content_json`, `_add_h5p_json`.
   - Define abstract methods for content-specific operations.

2. **Develop Content-Specific Packagers**
   - Create separate files for each content type (e.g., `drag_the_words_packager.py`).
   - Inherit from the base `H5PPackager` class.
   - Implement content-specific methods like `_add_content_files` and `_add_library_files`.

3. **Create Main Script with GUI**
   - Develop `main.py` with a GUI for user interaction.
   - Import all packager classes.
   - Implement logic to choose the appropriate packager based on user selection.

4. **Refine and Debug**
   - Test the packager with various content types.
   - Address import issues and naming conventions.
   - Implement proper error handling and validation.

5. **Optimize and Expand**
   - Refine the packaging process for efficiency.
   - Add support for additional content types as needed.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Consistent Naming**: Use underscores instead of hyphens in Python file names to avoid import issues.
2. **Modular Design**: A modular approach allows for easy addition of new content types.
3. **Import Management**: Careful management of imports is crucial for avoiding runtime errors.
4. **Content Validation**: Implement strict content validation to ensure H5P package integrity.
5. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling improves user experience and eases debugging.

## Future Improvements

1. Expand support for more H5P content types.
2. Enhance the GUI for a more intuitive user experience.
3. Implement logging for better tracking of the packaging process.
4. Add unit tests to ensure reliability across different scenarios.
5. Create comprehensive documentation for ease of use and future development.

## Steps for Adding New Content Types

1. Create a new file named `[content_type]_packager.py`.
2. Define a new class that inherits from `H5PPackager`.
3. Implement the required methods, especially `_add_content_files` and `_add_library_files`.
4. Update `main.py` to import the new packager and add it to the GUI options.
5. Test thoroughly with sample content of the new type.

By following this modular approach and learning from our development process, you can efficiently expand the H5P packager to support a wide range of content types while maintaining a clean and manageable codebase.
