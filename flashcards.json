Think about what might happen if a new predator was introduced into a habitat."}, {"question": "How does climate change impact ecosystems?", "answer": "Climate change can cause shifts in temperature and rainfall patterns, leading to changes in plant and animal life.  Can you predict how climate change might affect a specific ecosystem?"}, {"question": "What are some ways humans can help protect ecosystems?", "answer": "We can reduce pollution, conserve water, plant trees, and support sustainable practices. What else can you think of?"}, {"question": "Reflect on what you've learned about ecosystems. What surprised you most?", "answer": "This is your opportunity to share your thoughts and reflections on the amazing interconnectedness of life!"}]
